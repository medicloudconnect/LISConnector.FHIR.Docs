# Introduction

This FHIR server consists of a number of loosely coupled ASP.NET Core Web APIs that can be used to manage FHIR resources.  FHIR \(Fast Health Interoperability Resources\) is designed to enable information exchange of healthcare. The specification builds on and adapts modern, widely used RESTful practices.

You can access the various Web APIs on GitHub.
